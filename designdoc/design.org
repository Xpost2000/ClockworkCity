  These are in the order I want the progression to be.

  Wall Jumping | Gliding  (can get them at approximately the same time.)
  Deathfall (Allows falling in areas that are capable of killing players. (for later areas secrets))

* Offense Abilities
  Attack (and sprint attack)
  Dash Attack (Unlock later)
  "Parry" (Time correctly, for a free counter and no damage, Only usable against small enemies or same size bosses)
