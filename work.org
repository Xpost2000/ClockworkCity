* Prejam / Engine Creation
  The rules state
  #+begin_quote
  General purpose code, designing, bases and models,
  placeholders, and story can be made before the start of the
  jam. Here's clarification
  #+end_quote

  This is general purpose enough since I just need it for any open-world metroidvania. Design
  will be done outside repo maybe?

  I'm not expecting to target the web unlike with other gamejams since most metroidvanias ought to
  be long enough that I shouldn't be able to play through them in an average browser session ya know?

  I mean I'm using SDL2 so I guess I have that choice if I want

* Jam Time
  When the jam starts put tasks here. This is game-specific stuff,
  hopefully by this time I have a plan for the game plot and obviously
  the engine should be ready by this time (or good enough...)
